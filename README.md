# Netflix Clone

Netflix application using React Firebase & Styled Components.

You can find 4 pages: Sign In, Sign Up, browse & home. The last two ones are protected routes and you can acces them just if you have logged in.

Firebase firestore stores all the data used in this app (Series & Movies). Users info is stored in Firebase.

I also used fuse.js for live search to filter our series & movies by name.
